## 1D: The idea

You store already computed values in an array so you don't have to compute again. Then the problem you are currently trying to solved looks at 2 previous solved problems and takes them into account when computing the current thing you are solving

```
[ solved ][ solved ][ solving now ][ ? ][ ? ]
```
